### What is Blockchain?

**Blockchain** is a distributed ledger technology that allows data to be stored across a network of computers in a secure, tamper-resistant way. Each record, or "block," is linked to the previous one, forming a "chain" â€” hence the name. This makes it ideal for recording transactions, maintaining data integrity, and ensuring transparency.

**Key features of blockchain:**

* **Decentralized:** No central authority; data is shared across all nodes.
* **Immutable:** Once added, data cannot be altered without consensus.
* **Transparent:** Transactions are visible to all network participants.
* **Secure:** Uses cryptographic techniques to protect data.

### What is Hyperledger Fabric?

**Hyperledger Fabric** is a **permissioned blockchain framework** developed under the Linux Foundation's **Hyperledger project**. Unlike public blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric is designed for enterprise use where participants are known and trusted.

**Key features of Hyperledger Fabric:**

* **Permissioned network:** Only authorized parties can join and interact.
* **Modular architecture:** Pluggable components like consensus mechanisms.
* **Chaincode (smart contracts):** Business logic written in general-purpose languages like Go, Java, or Node.js.
* **Private channels:** Enables data isolation between specific participants.
* **High performance:** Designed for scalability and throughput.

Hyperledger Fabric is widely used in industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.
